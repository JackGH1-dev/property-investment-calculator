## [2.1.0] - 2025-08-20 - OAuth Authentication & Deployment Fixes

### üéâ Major Achievements
- **‚úÖ OAuth Authentication Fully Working** - Google OAuth sign-in now works correctly on production
- **‚úÖ Dashboard & Calculator Access Fixed** - Pages no longer redirect back to index after authentication
- **‚úÖ Production Deployment Optimized** - Vercel deployment issues resolved

### üîß Technical Fixes

#### Authentication System
- Fixed Firebase OAuth authentication flow with proper persistence settings
- Resolved "Missing or insufficient permissions" Firestore errors
- Added comprehensive authentication state management across all pages
- Implemented proper timing for authentication initialization (10+ second grace period)
- Added multi-tab support for Firestore persistence

#### Deployment & Routing
- **Root Cause Fixed**: Removed `package.json` that was forcing Vercel to treat site as Node.js project
- Eliminated server-level redirects that were preventing HTML files from loading
- Removed complex Vercel routing configuration that caused 404 errors
- Optimized for static HTML site deployment

#### Code Quality & Performance
- Removed duplicate `auth-production.js` script tags (was loading 3x, now loads 1x)
- Cleaned up all debugging code from production files
- Fixed console errors and warnings
- Optimized Firebase initialization sequence

### üöÄ Features Working
- **Google OAuth Sign-in**: Users can authenticate with Google accounts
- **Dashboard Access**: Authenticated users can access personalized dashboard
- **Calculator Access**: Property investment calculator works without authentication issues
- **Cross-page Authentication**: Auth state persists across all pages
- **Offline Support**: Firestore works offline with multi-tab synchronization

### üêõ Issues Resolved
1. **Dashboard/Calculator Redirect Loop** - Pages redirected to index after 0.5 seconds
2. **Test Page 404 Errors** - All test pages returned NOT_FOUND on Vercel
3. **Firebase Loading Multiple Times** - Script loaded 3x causing initialization conflicts
4. **Firestore Permission Errors** - "Missing or insufficient permissions" fixed
5. **Console Errors** - "Cannot read properties of undefined" debugger errors
6. **Authentication Timing** - Race conditions between auth initialization and page loads

### üìÅ Files Modified
- `dashboard.html` - Removed debug code, cleaned authentication flow
- `calculator.html` - Removed debug code, fixed duplicate script loading
- `index.html` - Fixed duplicate authentication script loading
- `auth-production.js` - Added multi-tab Firestore persistence support
- `dashboard-production.js` - Extended authentication wait times and error handling
- `vercel.json` - Removed (was causing routing conflicts)
- `package.json` - Disabled (was forcing Node.js build process)

### üîÑ Migration Notes
- Site now deploys as static HTML (no build process required)
- Authentication works immediately on production deployment
- All pages accessible without server-side redirect issues

### üéØ Next Steps
- Monitor authentication performance in production
- Consider adding loading states for better UX
- Potential optimizations for Firebase bundle size
