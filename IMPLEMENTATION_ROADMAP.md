â”œâ”€â”€ index.html              # Landing page - marketing focused
â”œâ”€â”€ calculator.html         # Calculator page - functionality focused  
â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css              # Global styles and components
â”œâ”€â”€ landing.css             # Landing page specific styles (optional)
â”œâ”€â”€ calculator.css          # Calculator page specific styles (optional)
â”œâ”€â”€ script.js               # Calculator functionality
â”œâ”€â”€ navigation.js           # Global navigation behavior
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md              # Project documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ CHANGELOG.md           # Version history
â”œâ”€â”€ CLAUDE.md              # AI assistant context
â”œâ”€â”€ DESIGN.md              # Design system documentation

```

### CSS Architecture Strategy
```css
/* Global styles in styles.css */
:root { /* Design tokens */ }
.global-nav { /* Navigation component */ }
.page-layout { /* Shared page structure */ }
.btn, .form-group { /* Shared components */ }

/* Page-specific styles */
.hero { /* Landing page hero */ }
.features { /* Landing page features */ }
.calculator-layout { /* Calculator layout */ }
```

### JavaScript Modularity
```javascript
// Global navigation functionality
// Shared utilities and helpers  
// Calculator-specific functionality
// Landing page interactions
```

## Success Metrics
